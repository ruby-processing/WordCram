WordCram is a library for Processing by [Dan Bernier][dan]. WordCram lets you generate word clouds in Processing. It does the heavy lifting – text analysis, collision detection – for you, so you can focus on making your word clouds as beautiful, as revealing, or as silly as you like. [ruby_wordcram gem][gem] is a ruby wrapper for the java processing library Wordcram library by [Dan Bernier][dan]. If you create processing sketches using [JRubyArt][jruby_art] or [propane][propane], mostly all you need to do is `require 'ruby_wordcram'` to use the WordCram library.
