See cue.language on [github][github] by Jonathan Feinberg, but you could also clone this repo to add an extension (French has already been modified to increase number of stop words by [C. Fuhrman][french]). It would kind of neat to include some more Non-English examples than my rather weak [Yin_Yang_mots.rb][mots].
