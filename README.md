### Wordle

Wordle is a toy for generating “word clouds” from text that you provide. The clouds give greater prominence to words that appear more frequently in the source text. The Wordle applet was created by by Jonathan Feinberg (when at IBM hence wordle has licence restrictions).

A key part of Wordle is the cue.language.jar (that is also included with wordcram).
cue.language is a small library of Java code and resources that provides the following basic natural-language processing capabilities:

    Tokenizing natural language text into individual words
    Tokenizing natural language text into sentences
    Tokenizing natural language text into n-grams (sequences of 2 or more words that appear next to each other in a sentence)
    Counting strings
    Detecting which script (alphabet, writing system) is required to represent a text
    Guessing what language a text is in
    Customizable "stop word" detection for a variety of languages
